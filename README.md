# Advent Of Code 2018 -- Unix Style #

I will play around with an idea of solving the the questions using unix
command-line tools as much as possible, restraining myself from the
"real programming".

I will not try to avoid awk, perl and bash, but where possible I will split
the code to fulfill a role in pipeline, instead of e.g. writing a single
perl script.

Obviously, I won't try to make the code optimized for cpu or memory usage,
but hell I will optimize for the most fun and joy!
